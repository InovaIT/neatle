NeatLE is an Android BTLE (Bluetooth low energy) support library that simplifies management of BTLE connections, subscriptions, devices and operations.
It provides a single entry point for all BTLE related operations.

## Features
 * Monitor a connection to a BTLE device.
 * Send read / write commands and receive responses.
 * Subscribe to characteristics and get notified of changes.

## Installation

Include the NeatLE library in your Android project as a Gradle dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'si.inova:neatle:0.8.1'
}
```


## Examples

### Monitor for connections:

A `ConnectionMonitor` tries to connect to a specific BTLE device, and if configured with `setKeepAlive(true)`, will try to maintain that connection until the monitor is stopped.
The `ConnectionStateListener` will be notified of any changes to the connection, (e.g. device connected / disconnected).

```java
ConnectionMonitor monitor =
        Neatle.createConnectionMonitor(context, Neatle.getDevice("00:11:22:33:44:55"));
monitor.setOnConnectionStateListener(new ConnectionStateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onConnectionStateChanged(Connection connection, int newState) {
        if(connection.isConnected()){
            // The device has connected
        }
    }
});
monitor.start();
```


### Create an operation:

An `Operation` is a series of read / write commands that can be executed for a specific BTLE device.
It can have multiple read **and** write operations, that will be executed on the device sequentially.

An operation can also be executed more than once.

```java
BluetoothDevice device = Neatle.getDevice("00:11:22:33:44:55");
UUID batteryService = Neatle.createUUID(0x180f);
final UUID batteryCharacteristic = Neatle.createUUID(0x2a19);

Operation operation = Neatle.createOperationBuilder(context)
        .read(batteryService, batteryCharacteristic)
        .onFinished(new OperationObserver() {
            @Override
            public void onOperationFinished(Operation op, OperationResults results) {
                if(results.wasSuccessful()){
                    int battery = results.getResult(batteryCharacteristic).getValueAsInt8();
                }
            }
        })
        .build(device);
operation.execute();
```


### Create a subscription:

A `Subscription` listens for notification events on a specific service for a specific characteristic on the BTLE device, and reports them back to the caller.
```java
BluetoothDevice device = Neatle.getDevice("00:11:22:33:44:55");
UUID batteryService = Neatle.createUUID(0x180f);
UUID batteryCharacteristic = Neatle.createUUID(0x2a19);

CharacteristicSubscription subscription =
        Neatle.createSubscription(context, device, batteryService, batteryCharacteristic);
subscription.setOnCharacteristicsChangedListener(new CharacteristicsChangedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCharacteristicChanged(CommandResult change) {
        if (change.wasSuccessful()) {
            int batteryLevel = change.getValueAsInt8();
        }
    }
});
subscription.start();
```
Note: An active subscription will keep a `ConnectionMonitor` with `setKeepAlive(false)` (the default setting) alive.
